# Discord Bot Development Part 2. By Mr Moth Devs
This source code belongs to the secod tutorial made for bot creations on MrMoth-devs youtube channel.
In this tutorial you will learn how to make a command handler.
What a command handler does is basically seperate the commands from eachothers meaning that you wont have to let every command in the main file (which is a real mess).
